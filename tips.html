        In some cases, the closing tag is optional you can add it or skip it. Adding optional closing tags can make HTML code easier to follow and understand. However, sometimes, the use of such tags can be redundant. Else, empty element do not need a closing tag to function, because there simply is no content for them to wrap around.
