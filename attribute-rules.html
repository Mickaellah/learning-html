            There are several attribute rules in html. If you want to write good, clean code you have to apply the attributes rules to make it looks good and easy to read.

            Those are the attribute rules which I know :
          </h2>
          <nav>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We are not allowed to use capital letters in an attribute name, especially at W3School we always use lowercase attribute name.
              </li>
              <li>
                In general, attribute value should have quotes to wrap around.
              </li>
              <li>
                Normaly, attribute value itself contains double quote are not allowed, use single quote instead.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attributes are separated with spaces.
              </li>
              <li>
                Public attributes can go on an element.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can only have dashes in the attribute name.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attributes must have name value pairs.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </nav>
